# PrimePredict(Inspired by Amazon)
AI-Powered Demand Forecasting API

PrimePredict is a FastAPI-based machine learning microservice that forecasts future product demand using historical sales data. Built to simulate Amazon-scale forecasting use cases, it uses time-series modeling (Prophet), scalable API architecture, and follows modern backend best practices.

This project was inspired by the Amazon particularly their emphasis on distributed systems, prediction at scale, and building production-level backend services.

How This Project Was Inspired by Amazon
PrimePredict was directly inspired by the Amazon Software Development Engineer Internship job description, which emphasizes:

1. Scalable Systems & Distributed Environments
Design and build innovative technologies in a large distributed computing environment.
This project emulates that by structuring the demand forecasting logic as a standalone, scalable API that can easily be containerized and distributed across multiple services (e.g., in a Kubernetes or AWS Lambda environment).

2. Prediction at Scale
Create solutions to run predictions on distributed systems.

3.PrimePredict implements a real-world forecasting use case predicting product demand based on historical data. which directly reflects Amazon's core operations in retail, inventory management, and logistics.

4. Customer Obsession
The intense focus we have on our customers is why we are one of the world’s most beloved brands.

5. Forecasting helps anticipate customer needs and ensures products are always in stock — enhancing user experience and minimizing delays. PrimePredict simulates this mindset by providing precise, customizable demand predictions for any product.

6. PrimePredict is built using FastAPI, a modern, agile framework ideal for rapid iteration and CI/CD-friendly deployment — reflecting Amazon's “two-pizza team” development philosophy.

7. The project integrates AI-based forecasting (using Prophet), a real-world application of machine learning in supply chain forecasting — a problem Amazon solves daily on a global scale.

8. Cloud-Ready Microservice Design
Amazon's architecture is based on microservices and cloud-native tools (mostly on AWS). PrimePredict was built to reflect that modular thinking:
